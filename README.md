# Commageddon

This script was developed in order to automate file name validation for Saks New York photo studio. A 56 column CSV file was generated based on their product tracking system and this script generated expected file names based on vender/merch data. Those expected file names were compared to the names of jpegs captured on set to ensure no products were missed and all assets were named correctly. 

## Before/After

This script replaced a manual process that required 8 hours of work per week and required multiple checks to minimize human error. After the script was deployed the same validation required only 4 minutes per day.
